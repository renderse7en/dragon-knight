# Dragon Knight
Many years ago, when I was young and dumb, I wrote a simple little game based on the game *Dragon Warrior* for the NES. It was fun, it helped me learn how to code, and a lot of people liked it.
I am now turning it over to the open source community. Fork it, do what you want, make it your own.
Couple things to keep in mind though:
- It's super old. It may not even work on modern versions of PHP. It may have security issues. I have no idea.
- I have moved on with my life, and am no longer changing or doing anything with this game.
- I am not providing help or support. You're on your own.
- I am not accepting pull requests. If you fork this, you are welcome to do whatever you want, but no changes will be merged back into this.
- Quite frankly, I don't really suggest that you use this as is. It's probably better as an inspiration for your own project. 
- Have fun with this. I gave it a lot of love a long time ago. I hope it inspires you to give something a lot of love as well.
- This Git repo represents the final released version, 1.1.11, originally released 3/26/2006.
